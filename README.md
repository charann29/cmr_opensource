# Build A Salary Prediction Web App With Streamlit

## Introduction

In this guide, we will build a machine learning web application from scratch in Python using Streamlit. We will use real-world data to build a machine learning model. The process will be divided into two parts:
1. Analyzing the data and building the model.
2. Creating the web app using Streamlit.
