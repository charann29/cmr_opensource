Helmet Detection and Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR)
===============================================================

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning for helmet detection and automatic license plate recognition (ALPR). It utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning models to achieve these functionalities.

Features
--------

-   **Helmet Detection:**
    -   Uses a trained machine learning model to detect whether a person is wearing a helmet or not.
    -   Provides bounding boxes around detected helmets in images or videos.
-   **Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR):**
    -   Recognizes license plates from images or videos.
    -   Utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to extract alphanumeric characters from license plates.

Installation
------------

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    bash

    Copy code

    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/helmet-alpr.git
    cd helmet-alpr`

2.  **Set up environment:**

    -   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

    -   Install dependencies:

        bash

        Copy code

        `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3.  **Download pretrained models (if necessary):**

    -   Follow instructions in `models/README.md` to download pretrained models for helmet detection and ALPR.

Usage
-----

### Helmet Detection

To use helmet detection, run:

bash

Copy code

`python helmet_detection.py --input path/to/image_or_video --output path/to/save/result`

Replace `path/to/image_or_video` with the path to your input image or video file. The output will be saved at `path/to/save/result`.

### Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR)

To perform ALPR, run:

bash

Copy code

`python alpr.py --input path/to/image_or_video --output path/to/save/result`

Replace `path/to/image_or_video` with the path to your input image or video file. The recognized license plates and their bounding boxes will be saved at `path/to/save/result`.
