The Diabetes Prediction Web App allows users to input various health parameters to predict the likelihood of having diabetes. The prediction is based on a machine learning model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.


To run this application, you need Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-webapp.git
    cd diabetes-prediction-webapp
    

2. Install the required packages:
   
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

3. Ensure you have the trained model file (`diabetes_trained_model.pkl`). If not, follow the instructions in the [Model Training](#model-training) section.

## Usage
To start the Streamlit web app, run:

streamlit run predict.py
